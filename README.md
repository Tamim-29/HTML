## Viewing the Project

### Using a Web Browser
1. Open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred browser by double-clicking it or dragging it into the browser window.

### Using a Live Server (Recommended)
If you have VS Code or another IDE, use the Live Server extension:
- Right-click `index.html` → Select **Open with Live Server**

This allows automatic reload on file changes.

## Troubleshooting
- If CSS or JavaScript changes don't show, clear your browser cache or try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)  
- Ensure your browser supports modern HTML5 and CSS3 features  
- Use a live server to avoid CORS or file protocol limitations for JavaScript
